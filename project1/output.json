The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln’s beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. “My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,” the president says at the time. “God has called him home.” Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy’s body. From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul. Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction’s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end? “A luminous feat of generosity and humanism.”—Colson Whitehead, The New York Times Book Review “A masterpiece.”—Zadie Smith",

From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul. Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction’s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end? “A luminous feat of generosity and humanism.”—Colson Whitehead, The New York Times Book Review “A masterpiece.”—Zadie Smith",

Fox 8 has always been known as the daydreamer in his pack, the one his fellow foxes regard with a knowing snort and a roll of the eyes. That is, until he develops a unique skill: He teaches himself to speak “Yuman” by hiding in the bushes outside a house and listening to children’s bedtime stories. The power of language fuels his abundant curiosity about people—even after “danjer” arrives in the form of a new shopping mall that cuts off his food supply, sending Fox 8 on a harrowing quest to help save his pack. Told with his distinctive blend of humor and pathos, Fox 8 showcases the extraordinary imaginative talents of George Saunders, whom The New York Times called “the writer for our time.”",

Named One of the Best Books of the Year by NPR, the San Francisco Chronicle, and Southern Living Lois Clary is a software engineer at General Dexterity, a San Francisco robotics company with world-changing ambitions. She codes all day and collapses at night, her human contact limited to the two brothers who run the neighborhood hole-in-the-wall from which she orders dinner every evening. Then, disaster! Visa issues. The brothers quickly close up shop. But they have one last delivery for Lois: their culture, the sourdough starter used to bake their bread. She must keep it alive, they tell her—feed it daily, play it music, and learn to bake with it. Lois is no baker, but she could use a roommate, even if it is a needy colony of microorganisms. Soon, not only is she eating her own homemade bread, she’s providing loaves to the General Dexterity cafeteria every day. Then the company chef urges her to take her product to the farmer’s market—and a whole new world opens up.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780374716431"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0374716439"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 273, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.7.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=12s6DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=12s6DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.ca/books?id=12s6DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%7B%22isbn%22:%220812995341%22%7D&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=12s6DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=12s6DgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "CA", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12.99, "currencyCode": "CAD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12.99, "currencyCode": "CAD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=12s6DgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-12s6DgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12990000, "currencyCode": "CAD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12990000, "currencyCode": "CAD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "CA", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.ca/books/download/Sourdough-sample-epub.acsm?id=12s6DgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=12s6DgAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Named One of the Best Books of the Year by NPR, the San Francisco Chronicle, and Southern Living Lois Clary is a software engineer at General Dexterity, a San Francisco robotics company with world-changing ambitions."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "nbRVCgAAQBAJ", "etag": "eX5ndcYfdhA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nbRVCgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Nest", "subtitle": "A Novel", "authors": ["Cynthia D"Aprix Sweeney"], "publisher": "HarperCollins", "publishedDate": "2016-03-22", "description": "A wickedly smart, funny and deeply felt debut novel about four adult siblings and the fate of their long depended-upon family inheritance On a wintry afternoon in New York City, Melody, Beatrice and Jack Plumb gather to confront their charismatic and reckless older brother, Leo, who has just been released from rehab. Leo’s bad behavior before entering rehab, culminating in a car crash while under the influence—a nineteen-year-old waitress beside him—has left the Plumbs’ joint trust fund—“The Nest,” as they’ve taken to calling it—endangered. All four siblings, at very different places in their lives, believe that this money will solve a host of self-inflicted problems and their consequences. And until Leo’s accident, they’d been mere months away from receiving it. Can Leo get the Plumbs out of this mess, as he’s always been able to do for himself before? Or will the Plumb siblings have to do without the money and the future lives they’ve envisioned? As the siblings grapple with family tensions, old histories, and the significant emotional and financial cost of the accident, Sweeney introduces an unforgettable cast of supporting characters: Leo’s stalwart ex-girlfriend who now thinks that maybe, just maybe, he is capable of change; the waitress whose life was shattered in the accident; the Iraqi war veteran who falls in love with her; and a retired, grieving firefighter with a very big secret. Tender, funny and deftly written, The Nest explores what money does to relationships, what happens to our ambitions over the course of our lives, and the fraught but unbreakable ties we have with our families.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781443445252"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1443445258"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.6.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nbRVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nbRVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.ca/books?id=nbRVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%7B%22isbn%22:%220812995341%22%7D&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nbRVCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nbRVCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "CA", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11.99, "currencyCode": "CAD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11.99, "currencyCode": "CAD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nbRVCgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-nbRVCgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11990000, "currencyCode": "CAD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11990000, "currencyCode": "CAD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "CA", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.ca/books/download/The_Nest-sample-epub.acsm?id=nbRVCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=nbRVCgAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Tender, funny and deftly written, The Nest explores what money does to relationships, what happens to our ambitions over the course of our lives, and the fraught but unbreakable ties we have with our families."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "aCqRvgEACAAJ", "etag": "67yJj1npdkY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/aCqRvgEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Gates Ajar", "authors": ["Elizabeth Stuart Phelps"], "publisher": "Franklin Classics Trade Press", "publishedDate": "2018-10-17", "description": "This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.
