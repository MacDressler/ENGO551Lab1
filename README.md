# ENGO551Lab1
Here is my submission for lab 1.

I used python, css, sql and html for this lab. The css is not done. I promise I will make the website look prettier for the next submission. The templates file contains all of my html files. This was required for flask. Book.html corresponds to each page. It takes the isbn in the python to create the correct book. Books is the search result page. login is the login page. This one won't let you through if you have the wrong info. login error is a file to make a page with an error. I thought it was funny, and I didn't like the way that the error looked on the same page. I think I will try and make this a pop up for the next lab. Login error 2 was more funny, but the link was annoying so I scrapped it. Search is the home page, and lets you search for books. Signup page lets you create a new account. It communicates with the database.

Application.py is the main file that runs the web app. Make sure to use the info at the bottom of the page to run the project. My favourite part was the search mechanism. It was fun reading about SQL. Books.csv was provided before. Models.py was something I saw on some websites for creating your database. They used it to create each table, and then linked it into your main application page. I was trying to do that but found it too many steps. import.py is the last file and it imports all of the books. It loops through the csv and does a new sql call on each row, which seems inefficient but it worked so here we go.

Thank you for looking at my project! 

I hope you enjoy.
